# meme-sentinel
A new structure that combines both a combiner network and bidirectional cross-attention for more effective interaction between images and
texts.
• Apply LoRA to CLIP to tune instruction by aligning its predictions
with proper task prompts, making it more understandable and useful
for many applications.
• Using prompt similarity to instruction embeddings competes well with
standard MLP classifiers.
• On the Hateful Memes Challenge and HarMeme datasets, the method
works very well and is able to perform equally well with real-world
datasets
